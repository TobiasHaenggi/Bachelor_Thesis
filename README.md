This project uses the PyTorch library to solve computer vision tasks with neural networks.
The aim of this project is to explore methods with which to select a number of images from the train set. 
The metrik is the accuracy compared on the complete train set, the abridged train set and multiple random selections of the train set

NOTE: As this project requires considerable training and continuous iterations, new code will only be added once having gone through numerous tests
